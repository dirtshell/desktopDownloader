A tool to download desktop wallpapers from reddit's SFWPorn network

***Windows Settings:*** In order to set your background to a slideshow on Windows, go to Start > Control Panel > Desktop Background and select a folder where you will have all your pictures stored in. Then click 'Select All' and change any of the settings at the bottom of the page to your liking. Then click save changes. Now, whenever a new picture is added to your slideshow folder, your desktop will automatically incorporate the new picture into the rotation. Then just make sure that you set the destination folder in the script to the slideshow folder and you should be set.
